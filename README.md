# Canvas-Download-Renamer
Run in a downloaded submissions folder from canvas to put each student's submission in its own file with its original filename

This can be useful for grading name dependant files in bulk (eg: .java files require the name to match the class), or just for improving your file organization.

To run:
1) Navigate to the file you wish to run it using ```cd```
2) Run the script using ```bash``` followed by where you put the file
